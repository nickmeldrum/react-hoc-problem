# react-hoc-problem

Solve 2 problems:

 1. why does your textbox keep losing focus whenever you type?
 2. your wrapped component "knows" about the hoc function - how could you fix this bad coupling?
 
Hints (have a think yourself first before reading these!):








 1. look at the componentDidMount function
 2. hoc's typically manipulate incoming props, or extend the wrapped component by adding functionality
